# CSS blur filter not working
This repository demonstrates a problem where the CSS `filter: blur()` property fails to apply to an element, even though there are no apparent conflicts or errors.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, and `bugSolution.css` provides a solution.

The issue is likely due to a less common interaction with other CSS properties or browser-specific quirks.  The solution explores and addresses these possibilities.
