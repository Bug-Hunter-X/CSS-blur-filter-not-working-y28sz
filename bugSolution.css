The problem might be due to the z-index or other stacking contexts. To fix this, make sure the element you want to blur is properly positioned in the stacking context. You might need to adjust the z-index. Here's a modified CSS example:

```css
#myElement {
  filter: blur(5px);
  z-index: 1; /* Ensure it's above other elements */
  position: relative; /*Needed for z-index to work*/
}
```

Another potential issue could be the combination of transforms or other filters. Try removing other filters applied to the element to see if that resolves the problem.  If multiple filters are used, ensure they're compatible. If the element is an inline element, try making it a block element using `display: block`.
